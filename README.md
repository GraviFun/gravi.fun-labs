# gravi.fun-labs

> Experimental features and chaotic physics ideas for the GraviFun playground.

This repository contains unstable mechanics, alternative experiments, and rapid tests built on top of the main GraviFun engine.

These features are not production-ready. They exist for fun, exploration, and prototyping.

- **experiments/**: small JS/TS files trying out physics logic
- **scenes/**: sandbox `.glb` files for weird scenarios
- **notes/**: scratch ideas, bug discoveries, unfinished thoughts

## ðŸ§ª Try at your own risk

These mechanics may not work. They might crash things. Thatâ€™s the point.
